Attack A:



Attack B:
1. 
Cross-Site Foragery - Zoobar's security is non-existent, so we are essentially able
to do whatever we could possibly want on the site inside someone's account...from a 
different site altogether.

2. 
Basically, we have some HTML code that, when run by the target, uses a hidden,
pre-filled-out form to transfer 10 Zoobars from the target's account to "attacker".
This form is aimed (action) at the transfer php page on the Zoobar site, so it provides a 
recipient (attacker) and number of Zoobars (10). We used an iframe so that when
the form is sent, it does not open up the transfer.php page in a separate tab, but 
rather, invisibly, on the same page. Once the page is loaded up (i.e. the transfer
went through), the page is redirected to Bing, leaving the target none-the-wiser.

3. 
I like the idea of a secret validation token (from lecture) in this case because
the attack relies on there being no surprises. At a minimum, adding a layer of 
validation would would make the attack far more difficult--and, if we were to employ 
some of the ideas we learned in class about hashing (hashing a session token) and 
making the hashing process slow, then it may become prohibitively expensive to crack. 



Attack C:
